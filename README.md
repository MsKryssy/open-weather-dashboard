## Open Weather Dashboard

## Description

This weather dashboard will provide weather conditions for cities across the US. When a user enters the city name and click search, the app will provide a 5-day weather forecast that matches the closest city of the name entered. If the city cannot be found, it will alert the user. Once searched, the city name will appear to the left of the screen and remain stored there in a list of searched cities.
